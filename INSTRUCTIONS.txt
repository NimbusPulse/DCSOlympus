INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1) Close any applications which may interfere with installation, including Digital Combat Simulator (DCS) and previous versions of Olympus.

2) If you DO NOT have Olympus already installed, SKIP THIS STEP. If you have already installed Olympus, do the following:
    a) If you installed DCS Olympus v1.0.3 using the installer, simply remove it using Windows's "Add or remove programs" application. 
    b) If you installed DCS Olympus v1.0.3 using the archived version, remove it by deleting the "...<DCS Saved Games folder>\Mods\Services\Olympus" folder. Do this for every DCS instance you installed Olympus in. 
       Remember to delete any shortcuts you created. Don't worry, they will be created automatically again by the installation script provided in this package

3) Execute the "install.bat" script by double-clicking on it. Wait for the installation script to complete.
	NOTE: depending on your Windows configuration, the script may be called "install" (without .bat at the end).

4) The new Olympus Manager will open. This will allow you to add/remove Olympus to individual DCS installations.
	Use the Olympus Manager and follow the instructions to install and setup Olympus.

5) Start DCS and run a mission. Make sure it is UNPAUSED.

6) Open Olympus via the shortcut and login using any username and the Gamemaster password set using the configurator. 
	Local installation: run the client from the provided shortcut, or visit "http://localhost:3000/" in a web browser (Google Chrome recommended). 
	Dedicated server: users must first start the Olympus server, then log in using any browser and visiting "http:\\<server IP>:<backend port>" (backend port is 3001 by default)

7) You can use the manager at any time to change the ports and/or passwords. If you do, REMEMBER TO RESTART OLYMPUS AND DCS.
