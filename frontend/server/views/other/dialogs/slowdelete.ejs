        <p>You are trying to delete a large amount of units (<span class="deletion-count"></span>), which can cause the server to lag for players.</p>
        <p>You may:
            <ul>
                <li>delete in batches (less lag but Olympus cannot process any additional orders until<br /> all units have been deleted);</li>
                <li>delete immediately (you can continue to give Olympus orders but players may<br />experience lag while this happens);</li>
